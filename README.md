## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a **Senior Data Analyst** with a solid background in Product Management, pivoting into **Data Science**.

With a seven-year career in the challenging Brazilian Fintech market, I have specialized in transforming raw data into actionable business strategies. My technical foundation is built on **6+ years of Advanced SQL** and business intelligence, which I now combine with emerging skills in **Python and Machine Learning**.

Currently, I am applying this hybrid skillset to solve complex problems, such as fraud detection and anomaly identification.
